# Hi!

This Repo contains arch linux installation instructions aswell as a techical write up on setting up a hardened installation of arch linux. 

### Project for ICT40120 | Cert IV - Information Technology (Networking)
#### ICTICT435 Create technical documentation
This unit describes the skills and knowledge required to create technical documentation that is clear and understandable for the target audience and both easy to navigate and apply.
It applies to individuals working as technical writers, designers, developers and support staff, who are required to produce technical support documents of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) related work.

> **Note:** No licensing, legislative or certification requirements apply to this unit at the time of publication.

# Table of Contents
[[README.md]] - you are here!
[[Project Document.md]] - supporting information :)

[[quick-setup.md]] - Shorter, Commands only.
[[technical-writeup.md]] - Write up + Instructions, Resources for further research.

> **Note:** This is a technical guide intended for users already comfortable with Linux basics and Arch Linux installation procedures. It assumes UEFI-capable hardware with TPM 2.0 support. For brevity, general Linux installation steps (like setting locale or creating a user) are mentioned but not deeply explained. Always refer to the official Arch Wiki for the most up-to-date details on specific commands and configuration files.

Linux is a widely used open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for a variety of operating systems, collectively known as Linux distributions (distros). Linux is renowned for its flexibility, security, and customization, making it an ideal choice for developers, system administrators, and power users.

Arch Linux, a rolling release distribution, is one of the most popular and powerful Linux distros available. Known for its simplicity and minimalism, Arch gives users complete control over their system. Unlike many user-friendly distros that come with pre-installed software, Arch provides a clean slate, allowing users to build their systems from the ground up.

For clarity and readability, documentation related to system setup and installation is written in **Markdown** format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows easy formatting of text, headings, lists, links, and more.

- **Code blocks** are used extensively in technical documentation to provide clear examples of terminal commands or configuration files. For example:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```
