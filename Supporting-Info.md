This guide provides a comprehensive setup for Arch Linux with Secure Boot, TPM, and BTRFS, with a focus on security, performance, and customization while following best practices for documentation. Users who follow the documentation should be able to create a manually configured, secure Arch Linux environment ready for desktop or server applications.

# **Supporting Information**

Consult the [Arch Wiki Hardware Pages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Laptops) for additional configuration tips tailored to your device, such as touchpad gestures, power management, or device-specific quirks.

### **mkinitcpio and Unified Kernel Images**

The **mkinitcpio** tool is used to generate an initial ramdisk (initrd) image for Linux systems. This initrd is essential during the boot process as it contains the necessary drivers and modules required to mount the root filesystem and initialize the kernel.

A **Unified Kernel Image (UKI)** is a single, self-contained image that includes the kernel and initrd. It simplifies the boot process by reducing the number of files and components needed to start the system. UKIs are becoming more common due to their ease of deployment and ability to enhance the security of the boot process.

## **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Secure Boot**

**Secure Boot** is a security standard developed to ensure that a system only boots trusted software. It works by verifying that each piece of software (including bootloaders, kernel, and drivers) is signed with a trusted key before being loaded into the system. If the software isnâ€™t signed with a valid key, the boot process is halted, preventing malicious software (such as rootkits) from running.

Secure Boot provides protection against certain types of attacks, such as **Evil Maid attacks**, where an attacker with physical access to the machine tries to replace critical files to compromise the system.
### **What is TPM?**

The **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** is a hardware-based security feature that provides cryptographic functionality to ensure data integrity and privacy. TPM is designed to protect sensitive data, such as encryption keys, by securely storing them in hardware, thus preventing unauthorized access even in the event of a physical attack.

TPM is essential for hardware-based security features like **BitLocker encryption** and **Secure Boot**, which help ensure that the device remains secure throughout its operation, from boot to shutdown.

### **Attacks and Protection**

While Secure Boot and TPM offer substantial protection against certain attack vectors, they do not protect against all types of attacks. For example, they do not prevent attacks after the operating system has booted, such as malware infections or privilege escalation attacks within the OS. It is crucial to implement additional security measures like encryption, firewalls, and regular system updates to protect against these risks.

### **Evil Maid Attacks**

An **Evil Maid attack** occurs when an attacker with physical access to a system replaces or modifies critical files, such as the bootloader or kernel, with malicious versions. The attacker typically aims to gain access to encrypted data or install malware on the system. Secure Boot and TPM significantly mitigate the risk of such attacks by ensuring that only trusted software can be executed during the boot process.

## **Formatting and Documentation Standards**

For clarity and readability, documentation related to system setup and installation is typically written in **Markdown** format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows easy formatting of text, headings, lists, links, and more.

- **Code blocks** are used extensively in technical documentation to provide clear examples of terminal commands or configuration files. For example:
```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

This ensures that commands are presented in a way that is easy for users to copy and paste directly into their terminals.

### **Distributing the Arch Linux Installation Guide**

The installation guide has been distributed via **GitHub**, where users can access, fork, and contribute to the guide. GitHub is widely used for open-source projects, and it allows users to easily collaborate, report issues, and track changes in the documentation.
